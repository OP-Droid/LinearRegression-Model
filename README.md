Benefit for Traffic Accident Analysis and Prevention in Underdeveloped Countries:

Resource Allocation: By predicting accident severity, authorities in underdeveloped countries can allocate resources more effectively. They can prioritize areas with a higher predicted severity for enhanced safety measures and emergency response planning.

Infrastructure Planning: The model can guide infrastructure development. High severity areas may require improvements such as better road signage, speed control measures, or additional traffic signals.

Preventive Measures: Understanding the factors influencing accident severity allows for targeted preventive measures. This could include awareness campaigns, educational programs, or stricter enforcement of traffic rules.

Emergency Response: Predicted severity can help emergency services prepare for potential incidents. Areas with higher predicted severity may require additional resources to ensure timely and effective response.

Policy Decision Support: Policymakers can use the model to inform policy decisions related to road safety. Evidence-based decision-making is crucial for developing effective policies that address the specific challenges of underdeveloped regions.

Community Engagement: The predictions can be used in community engagement initiatives. Local communities can be informed about the risks, and participatory approaches can be employed to involve them in road safety initiatives.
